# FIFAProphet
Predict which side will win!

FIFAProphet predicts match results based on the previous world cup match records. Using a feed forward neural network (Multi Layer Perceptron), the program predicts the winning team. The training data includes results of all world cup matches from 1950.
By taking past match records, the classifier has three possible numeric outputs, viz., "0" for Draw, "1" for Team 1 and "2" for Team 2.

## Requirements:
pybrain, pandas, pygal, ipython, scikit-learn

P.S. Don't place your bets without using it ;)
